<h1>About</h1>
I am a guitarist, first and foremost.
<br/><br/>

I have played in many different ensembles comprised of many different instrumentations as well as being a solo performer. I am classically-trained and play a variety of styles, including Flamenco, Bossa Nova, Classical, Pop and Rock.
<br/><br/>

As a performer, I try to convey the essence of the music to the listener, whether it's a light-hearted Bossa Nova groove or a haunting, Impressionist melody. There is nothing more pleasing to me than a positive reaction from my listeners.


<h1>Lessons</h1>
I am a passionate music teacher with experience in helping students deepen their appreciation and understanding of music while developing their playing abilities.
<br/><br/>

I have been a private guitar instructor since 2002, and was trained at the Brooklyn College Conservatory. I studied classical technique, and it provided me with the tools to be able to analyze any technical problem, be it right hand, left hand, fingerstyle, or pick. I have experience with both young children and adults. I teach my students to be active listeners, to be able to identify the building blocks of the music they like and to be able to manipulate them into their own musical vocabulary.
<br/><br/>

I am a creative and flexible teacher. I always make sure the lessons are fun and engaging. I spend time finding out what my studentsâ€™ goals are and help them develop a challenging but realistic plan for achieving those goals. For younger students who may not have concrete goals, I show them how music can enrich their lives and help them develop at their own pace. My primary goal As a teacher, is to help students develop the tools for teaching themselves.

<h1>Bookings</h1>
	Want to make that special occasion even more memorable?
<br/><br/>

I have played at many parties, cocktail hours, weddings, and other events.
<br/><br/>

I can play a variety of styles so whether you're looking for an intimate concert to share with your loved ones, or light background music for your teatime, I will provide a professional and personalized experience.

<p>Testimonials</p>
Yotam is an excellent teacher. I took, overall, around 15 lessons with him. I had no prior experience with the guitar (other than letting it collect dust), and by my fifth or sixth lesson, I was already playing Jimi Hendrix's Hey Joe, including the solo.
<br/><br/>
I have been playing for a little less than two years now, and I'm playing a variety of styles, following my own regiment, and am even giving lessons to a couple of my friends. Yotam taught me some aspects on guitar playing (that I will not mention for free here) that I would NEVER have been able to figure out on my own.

<br/><br/>

I began to take lessons with Yotam four months before my audition for the Brooklyn College Conservatory of Music. Thanks to his help I passed the audition and was accepted into the guitar program.  I'm now on my way to earning a degree in music and education.
<br/><br/>

Yotam is a very thoughtful and inspiring teacher. He pushed me to work hard and to develop my musicality. In every lesson with Yotam he would remind me to become the owner of the song and not to just borrow it, but to own it and become the author. I liked having lessons with Yotam because he is very relaxed and has an easygoing approach that made me feel calm about my guitar playing. I often had a bad habit of rushing through my music when I was learning it or performing it. He helped me harness my emotionally-charged tempo changes by helping me find the moments in songs where those feelings belonged. He was also a great resource because he helped find music that was appropriate for my style and strengths. Yotam is a wonderful teacher as well as a friend.

Yotam is a fantastic guitar teacher! He is both patient and motivating. My own fear of guitar teachers was that they were always losing patience with me; not once did I feel this from Yotam. Additionally, he would let me learn the songs I asked to learn while trying to encourage exercises that would bridge my weakness with my strengths--a sign of a thinking teacher! I wholeheartedly recommend him to both the novice and the advanced student.

<br/><br/>

Yotam is an amazing guitarist and teacher. I've learned more about guitar in these past three months that I did in a year of learning from books, CDs, DVDs and the Internet. I've learned various techniques, songs, and music theory through my lessons. Yotam incorporates modern and classical music into his lessons, which I've benefited from, and was the first to teach me fingerstyle guitar playing.
<br/><br/>

As a teacher Yotam is patient, laid back, friendly, and attentive, especially to subtle notes. Yotam corrects my mistakes, explains the proper way to play the songs/exercises, and makes sure I understand before proceeding. My guitar playing has progressed and I can now play songs I was once daunted by. Yotam's continuous encouragement has helped me build confidence to continue to play music and love it. I strongly recommend Yotam as a guitar teacher--the prices are reasonable and the lessons are taught in a comfortable environment. He's a dedicated teacher and incredible guitarist--plus, he's funny!
